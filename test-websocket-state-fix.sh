echo "🎯 Problem identified: WebSocket state was being reset when switching components"
echo "🔧 Solution: Moved WebSocket state to App component level"
echo ""
echo "📋 What was changed:"
echo "1. WebSocket state now lives in App component (not in child components)"
echo "2. Functions are passed down as props to AdminLogin and ParticipantLogin"
echo "3. This prevents state reset when switching between components"
echo ""
echo "🧪 Test Steps:"
echo "1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)"
echo "2. Open Developer Tools (F12) → Console tab"
echo "3. Clear console (Ctrl+L)"
echo "4. Click 'Я организатор'"
echo "5. Click 'Создать квиз'"
echo "6. Watch console logs"
echo ""
echo "✅ Expected behavior:"
echo "🔄 [App] App component render started"
echo "🔄 [useQuiz] Hook render started"
echo "✅ [WebSocket] Connection opened successfully"
echo "🚀 [useQuiz] wsServiceRef.current after setting: [object]"
echo "🔵 [App] Admin button clicked"
echo "🔄 [AdminLogin] AdminLogin component render started"
echo "🏠 [AdminLogin] handleCreateRoom() called"
echo "📤 [useQuiz] sendEvent() called"
echo "📤 [useQuiz] Using WebSocket service: [object] (NOT null!)"
echo "✅ [useQuiz] Event sent successfully"
echo ""
echo "❌ Should NOT see:"
echo "❌ [useQuiz] WebSocket service not available"
echo "❌ [useQuiz] wsServiceRef.current: null"
echo ""
echo "🎉 If you see the WebSocket service object instead of null, the fix worked!"
