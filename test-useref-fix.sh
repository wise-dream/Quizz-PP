echo "🔧 PowerPoint Quiz - useRef Fix Test"
echo "==================================="
echo ""
echo "🎯 This test verifies that the useRef fix resolves the WebSocket service closure issue"
echo ""
echo "📋 What was fixed:"
echo "- Added useRef to store WebSocket service reference"
echo "- Updated all functions to use wsServiceRef.current instead of wsService state"
echo "- Removed wsService from useCallback dependencies"
echo "- Fixed closure issue where functions couldn't access updated WebSocket service"
echo ""
echo "🧪 Test Steps:"
echo "1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)"
echo "2. Open Developer Tools (F12) → Console tab"
echo "3. Click 'Я организатор'"
echo "4. Click 'Создать квиз'"
echo "5. Watch console logs"
echo ""
echo "✅ Expected logs (after useRef fix):"
echo "🏠 [useQuiz] createRoom() called"
echo "🏠 [useQuiz] wsServiceRef.current: [WebSocketService object]"
echo "🏠 [useQuiz] wsServiceRef.current isConnected: true"
echo "📤 [useQuiz] sendEvent() called"
echo "📤 [useQuiz] wsServiceRef.current: [WebSocketService object]"
echo "📤 [useQuiz] WebSocket service available in ref, checking connection..."
echo "📤 [useQuiz] WebSocket is connected, sending event..."
echo "✅ [useQuiz] Event sent successfully"
echo ""
echo "❌ Old logs (before fix):"
echo "❌ [useQuiz] WebSocket service not available"
echo ""
echo "🔍 Key differences:"
echo "- Now using wsServiceRef.current instead of wsService state"
echo "- No dependency on wsService in useCallback"
echo "- Ref always contains the latest WebSocket service instance"
echo ""
echo "📝 Technical explanation:"
echo "useRef creates a mutable reference that persists across renders"
echo "Unlike state, ref.current doesn't trigger re-renders when updated"
echo "This ensures functions always access the latest WebSocket service"
