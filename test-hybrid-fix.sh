echo "🔧 PowerPoint Quiz - Hybrid Ref/State Fix Test"
echo "============================================="
echo ""
echo "🎯 This test verifies that the hybrid approach (ref + state fallback) works"
echo ""
echo "📋 What was implemented:"
echo "- Added detailed logging to track both ref and state"
echo "- Implemented fallback: try ref first, then state"
echo "- Added wsService back to useCallback dependencies"
echo "- Enhanced logging to debug the issue"
echo ""
echo "🧪 Test Steps:"
echo "1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)"
echo "2. Open Developer Tools (F12) → Console tab"
echo "3. Click 'Я организатор'"
echo "4. Click 'Создать квиз'"
echo "5. Watch console logs carefully"
echo ""
echo "✅ Expected logs (after hybrid fix):"
echo "🚀 [useQuiz] wsServiceRef.current after setting: [WebSocketService object]"
echo "🏠 [useQuiz] wsService state: [WebSocketService object]"
echo "📤 [useQuiz] Using WebSocket service: [WebSocketService object]"
echo "📤 [useQuiz] WebSocket service available, checking connection..."
echo "✅ [useQuiz] Event sent successfully"
echo ""
echo "🔍 Key things to check:"
echo "1. Is wsServiceRef.current set correctly after connection?"
echo "2. Is wsService state populated?"
echo "3. Does the fallback logic work?"
echo "4. Is the WebSocket service accessible?"
echo ""
echo "📝 Debugging info:"
echo "- Ref should be set immediately when WebSocket connects"
echo "- State should also be populated"
echo "- Fallback should use whichever is available"
echo "- Both should point to the same WebSocket service instance"
